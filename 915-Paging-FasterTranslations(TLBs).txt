chopping address space into small, fixed-sized units,pages, paging requires a large amount of mapping information.
genarly stored in physical memory, paging requiers an extra memory lookup for each virtual address generated by the programe.
Going to memory for translation information before every instruction fetch or explicit load or store is prohibitively slow.

how we can speed address translation? and avoid extra memory ? what hardware support is required? what OS involvement is needed?
